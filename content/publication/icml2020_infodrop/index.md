abstract: "In this work, we attempt at improving various kinds of robustness universally by alleviating CNN's **texture bias**. With inspiration from the **human visual system**, we propose to discriminate texture from shape based on **local self-information** in an image, and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output from the local texture. We observe enhanced robustness under various scenarios (**domain generalization, few-shot classification, image corruption, and adversarial perturbation**)."
